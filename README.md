Magnetic Mayhem is a first-person shooter with a magnetic shooting mechanic.
The player can choose to shoot magnetic warheads with a positive (red) or negative (blue) charge.
These warheads stick to surfaces and activate a magnetic field around them, attracting or repelling nearby metallic objects based on their polarity.
Additionally, the player can take control of certain metallic objects to solve environmental puzzles.

The game features an asynchronous scene loading system that allows the player to be transported between different areas.
